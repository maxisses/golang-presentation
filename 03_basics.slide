# Basics

## Typing

- Go is _statically typed_.
- Data Types
    - Numbers
        - Integers (signed: `int8`, unsigned: `uint8`)

            ```
            var myIntVar int = 23
            ```
        - Floating-Point Numbers

            ```
            var myFloatVar float64 = 3.14
            ```
    - Strings

        ```
        var myString string = "Hello World"
        ```
    - Booleans
        ```
        var myBool bool = true
        ```

## Structs and Interfaces

- Struct is a type that contains named fields
  - User-defined data type
- Interface is a type that defines a method set
  - Method set: list of methods a type must have in order to implement the interface

## Struct Example

.play presentation_code/basicsStruct.go

## Interface Example

.play presentation_code/basicsInterface.go

## Packages

## Garbage Collection

- The runtime library implements garbage collection, concurrency, stack management, and other critical features of the Go language.
- Via `GOGC` the garbage collector can be controlled. 

## Compilation - Under the hood

.link https://github.com/golang/go/tree/master/src/cmd/compile


Go programs are compiled ahead of time to native machine code

1. Parsing
2. Type-checking and AST transformations
3. Generic SSA (Static Single Assignment)
4. Generating machine code

## Compilation - Choose your target

**One source - Many targets**
- `GOOS=linux` - `GOARCH=arm`
- `GOOS=linux` - `GOARCH=amd64`
- `GOOS=linux` - `GOARCH=ppc64le`
- `GOOS=windows` - `GOARCH=amd64`
- `GOOS=darwin` - `GOARCH=amd64`

*Go is statically compiled down to its targetâ€™s native machine and mostly outperforms its virtualized (e.g. Java, Kotlin) and interpreted (e.g. JavaScript) counterparts.*

## Formatting

- `gofmt` is an auto-formatter
- Formatted code is
  - easier to **write**
  - easier to **ready**
  - easier to **maintain**
  - **uncontroversial**

## Concurrency - Goroutines
Functions which are executed concurrent are called `goroutine`. These are defined as following ([proc.go](https://golang.org/src/runtime/proc.go)):

```
The main concepts are:
G - goroutine.
M - worker thread, or machine.
P - processor, a resource that is required to execute Go code.
    M must have an associated P to execute Go code, however it can be
    blocked or in a syscall w/o an associated P.
```

A `goroutine` is assigned to a Thread which is assigned to a physical CPU.

## Concurrency - Goroutines Example

.play presentation_code/basicsGoroutine.go

## Concurrency - Channels

`Channels` provide a way for two `goroutines` to communicate with each other and synchronize their execution.

## Concurrency - Channels Example

.play presentation_code/basicsChannels.go

## Concurrency - Channels Direction & Buffer

- Channels can be directed - only send or only receive
- Channels are by default _unbuffered_ - only accept sends `(chan <-)` if there is a corresponding receive `(<- chan)` ready

.play presentation_code/basicsBuffer.go
